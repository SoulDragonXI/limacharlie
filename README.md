We are happy and sad to say that LimaCharlie, the open source realtime endpoint detection and response stack is no
longer available as an open source project.

Happy because LimaCharlie is now reborn as [LimaCharlie Enterprise](https://www.refractionpoint.com/).<br/>
This new offering brings enterprise support and a whole new server that targets typical enterprise needs.<br/>
We will be expanding our offerings over the next few months but feel free to drop us a line if you'd like to be an early
customer.<br/>
LCE is an incredible combination of pricing and enterprise integration.

Sad because with all this we no longer have the ability to maintain the open source version.<br/>
We do plan on re-openning parts as time goes on and we also plan on offering our support to the community by way of various
educational and researcher licenses.
