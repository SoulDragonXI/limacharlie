The open source version of [LimaCharlie](https://limacharlie.io) has been deprecated and is no longer supported.

To increase its capability and ease-of-use LimaCharlie has been rolled up into a commercial product that delivers a full stack of information security infrastructure on demand in a fashion similar to Amazon Web Services or the Google Cloud Platform.

The LimaCharlie commercial version offers a free tier (no credit card required) of two sensors that includes a years worth of telemetry storage and search. It should take you less than 10 minutes to get data flowing from an endpoint after you [sign up](https://app.limacharlie.io/) (it is really that easy).
